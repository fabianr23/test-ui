Exercise to reply a design with HTML and CSS3, and basic functionality to add likes using only vanilla js

Comments:
In this exercise I tried to use only vanilla js because is a light project, is not necessary to use a complete framework o library to do things that can be achieve directly with the language in a good way (I think).
On another hand, still some missings or mistakes between the image provided and the psd.

To do the main functionality I tried with web components because I think that this allow us to make modular webs even without frameworks, some functionality is missing like css transitions, or another javascript adds, (like implementing observer to do some light animations), or adding server functionality to avoid the CORS issue when a script type module is called. btw, this can be a good exercise to improve this first step.

To see the exercise only is necessary to clone the project and executed the index.html (from master or develop branches)
